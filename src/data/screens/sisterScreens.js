  <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">A core strength of Solutions by STC is its network of sister companies and strategic partners – specialized firms (many acquired or invested in by Solutions) that broaden the range of solutions and industry expertise available under the STC umbrella. In the context of the Innovation Lab, these sister companies demonstrate "world-class innovative capabilities" that, combined with Solutions by STC, create end-to-end technological possibilities. Below is an overview of each key subsidiary/affiliate, their offerings, industry focus, and any notable success stories:</p>

  <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
    <h4 style="color: #7C3AED; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Giza Systems (and Giza Arabia) – Industry-Focused System Integrator</h4>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Giza Systems (headquartered in Egypt) is one of the Middle East's leading digital transformation enablers and systems integrators, established in 1974. Solutions by STC completed the acquisition of ~88.2% of Giza Systems in October 2022, making it a sister company. Giza Systems specializes in designing and deploying industry-specific technology solutions for asset-intensive sectors such as Telecom, Utilities, Oil & Gas, Transportation/Smart Mobility, and more. It has a presence in over 25 countries worldwide, serving clients across the Middle East, Africa, and beyond.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Giza's capabilities span systems and application integration, automation, and emerging technologies. For example, Giza has deep expertise in telecom OSS/BSS integration (it became the No.1 OSS/BSS provider in Egypt by 2004), utility sector automation (smart grids, smart meters), and public sector solutions. Giza Arabia, the KSA-based subsidiary (established 2006), has over 600 professionals in Saudi and is instrumental in delivering projects locally. Giza Arabia recently expanded into enterprise software services by acquiring Logical Applications for Business Solutions (LABS), a top SAP Gold Partner (details on LABS below). This move enhances Giza's ability to provide 360° digital transformation solutions, including ERP and analytics, to government and enterprise clients in Saudi Arabia.</p>

    <p><strong>Success stories:</strong> Giza Systems has an extensive project portfolio. In telecom, it has led OSS/BSS overhauls for operators; in smart cities, Giza delivered integrated command & control centers and intelligent transportation systems. Giza's subsidiary VAS (VAS Integrated Solutions) is a distributor for Dell Technologies, and in 2024 Solutions by STC leveraged VAS to become a direct Dell distributor in KSA – an example of cross-company synergy improving offerings. Giza has also implemented advanced solutions like smart building management in Africa and smart mobility systems. Overall, Giza's strong industry domain knowledge complements Solutions by STC's breadth, allowing the combined entity to deliver specialized solutions (e.g. utility automation with STC connectivity, or telecom solutions with STC's cloud and managed services).</p>

  <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
    <h4 style="color: #7C3AED; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Nile – Secure Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) Provider</h4>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Nile is a Silicon Valley-based provider of next-generation enterprise networking, delivering campus networks "as a service." In 2023, Solutions by STC announced a strategic investment in Nile and a partnership to exclusively offer Nile's Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) solutions in the Middle East. Founded by industry veterans (including ex-Cisco leaders), Nile has quickly gained a reputation for its secure, cloud-managed wired and wireless networking solutions delivered entirely via subscription.</p>

    <p>For Solutions by STC, Nile brings cutting-edge networking technology – high-performance Wi-Fi 6/6E and switching with built-in security and AI-driven management – which enriches STC's Connectivity and Managed Services portfolio. Together, Solutions and Nile are working to redefine enterprise networking in Saudi Arabia and the region by providing fully managed, scalable campus network services that reduce complexity for customers. The partnership covers Saudi and neighboring markets (Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt), positioning Solutions by STC as a regional pioneer in offering NaaS. This is especially relevant for smart buildings, hospitals, universities, and large offices that seek agile network infrastructure. While Nile is a newer startup, its innovative approach (secure connectivity delivered like a utility) aligns with STC's vision for modern, software-defined networks. As a success milestone, Nile's technology and Solutions by STC's market reach combined to raise a $175M funding round (co-led by STC's venture arm) to fuel this joint venture.</p>

  <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
    <h4 style="color: #7C3AED; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">AvidBeam – AI Video Analytics and Smart Surveillance</h4>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">AvidBeam is an artificial intelligence video analytics company that became part of the STC family via Giza Systems' investments. Giza acquired a stake in AvidBeam in 2021 and today Solutions by STC (through Giza) owns majority stakes in AvidBeam's regional entities. AvidBeam specializes in advanced computer vision and big data video processing – essentially turning live camera feeds and video archives into actionable insights using AI. Its solutions are used in smart cities, security, traffic management, retail analytics, and industrial monitoring. For example, AvidBeam's software can analyze CCTV footage in real-time to detect and track vehicles for intelligent traffic control or perform facial recognition for security and visitor management.</p>

    <p>One notable success is AvidBeam's project with the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Center (KAPSARC) in Riyadh. AvidBeam was awarded a mega-project by KAPSARC to deploy AI-powered video analytics solutions, including AvidFace (a smart face recognition system for people flow monitoring) and AvidGuard (an intelligent early warning system for operations and law enforcement in smart campuses). These solutions set new benchmarks for security and efficiency in Saudi, demonstrating how AI can enhance safety in research and commercial communities. By integrating AvidBeam's capabilities, Solutions by STC can offer smart surveillance, crowd analytics, and traffic monitoring solutions as part of its smart city and public safety offerings. This has cross-company synergy – e.g. pairing STC's IoT connectivity and cloud with AvidBeam's AI analytics to deliver end-to-end "safe city" platforms. AvidBeam's technology also complements STC's telecom infrastructure by driving demand for edge computing (processing video at network edge) and high-bandwidth connectivity (for streaming video data).</p>

    <h4 style="color: #7C3AED; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">ARIA Technologies – Industrial Automation and Robotics</h4>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">ARIA Technologies is a Giza Systems subsidiary (60% owned) launched in 2021 to focus on industrial automation, robotics, and smart manufacturing. ARIA is essentially an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and systems integrator for advanced factory automation solutions, including robotic arms, automated guided vehicles, machine vision systems, and Industrial IoT. It targets manufacturing companies in sectors like industrial goods, electronics, and petrochemicals, helping them optimize production through technology. ARIA provides turnkey automation and energy optimization solutions to these industries, often implementing complete assembly line automation or energy management systems for factories.</p>

    <p>One example of ARIA's innovative work is its high-speed QR code and barcode scanning solution unveiled at the ARIA Automation Lab in collaboration with Cognex. This solution integrates Cognex machine vision systems to achieve extremely fast and accurate scanning in manufacturing lines – setting a new standard in industrial automation for quality control and tracking. ARIA is also involved in robotic welding solutions and other Industry 4.0 technologies to improve precision and reduce downtime in production. As part of Solutions by STC's family, ARIA brings expertise in smart factory (Industry 4.0) technologies. This means Solutions by STC can jointly offer to clients in the manufacturing sector a combination of ARIA's automation hardware/software with STC's connectivity (5G private networks in factories), edge computing, and IoT platforms. The result is a comprehensive Smart Manufacturing proposition under the STC umbrella. ARIA's focus on innovation and lab prototypes (such as its Automation Lab) also makes it a great showcase in the Innovation Hub for cutting-edge industrial tech.</p>

    <h4 style="color: #7C3AED; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Devoteam Middle East – Digital Transformation Consulting</h4>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Devoteam Middle East is the regional arm of Devoteam, a global consulting firm specializing in digital strategy, technology consulting, and IT services. In early 2024, Solutions by STC completed the acquisition of a 40% stake in Devoteam Middle East, forging a strategic partnership to combine strengths. Devoteam is renowned for its expertise in areas like cloud computing, data analytics, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and IT service management – essentially, high-end consulting and professional services that guide organizations through digital transformation. This partnership brings together Solutions by STC's delivery capabilities with Devoteam's consulting and design expertise.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">As Solutions' CEO put it, the alliance enables "seamlessly integrated and innovative services, adhering to the highest digital standards to meet evolving market demands". From strategy through design to execution, clients will benefit from the combined portfolio.</p>

    <p>In practice, Devoteam consultants can work alongside Solutions by STC teams to, for example, craft a digital transformation roadmap for a customer, implement IT Service Management (ITSM) solutions (Devoteam is strong in ServiceNow and ITIL practices), or develop data governance frameworks – which Solutions can then execute and manage. Devoteam's global experience (originating from Europe) and methodologies enhance the "consultative" and innovative dimension of Solutions by STC's offerings. Already, Devoteam and Solutions by STC have signed an MoU to explore joint investments and collaborations in emerging tech areas. For the Innovation Lab, Devoteam's involvement highlights thought leadership in new tech (e.g. how to leverage AI responsibly, how to implement agile enterprises), adding a strong advisory component to the showcased solutions.</p>

    <h4 style="color: #7C3AED; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Upsource by Solutions – Premier BPO and Customer Experience Provider</h4>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Upsource by Solutions is Solutions by STC's Business Process Outsourcing subsidiary, focused on delivering outsourced services like contact center operations, customer care, tech support, and back-office processing. Founded in 2011 and now wholly owned by Solutions, Upsource is Saudi Arabia's premier BPO provider. Impressively, Upsource serves over 100+ clients across diverse industries with a workforce of 9,000+ employees. It operates multiple delivery centers (in Riyadh, Jeddah, Qassim, and Madinah) and was the first BPO in the Kingdom to achieve COPC certification for operational excellence.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Upsource's core offerings include managing large customer contact centers (voice, email, chat support), handling back-office processes (finance & accounting, HR services), and providing technical helpdesks – all tailored for the local market but at global standards. Upsource blends local expertise with global best practices in customer experience, which is evidenced by partnerships like the recent alliance with Cognizant (Feb 2025). In that partnership, Upsource and Cognizant are bringing advanced AI and automation into BPO services – e.g. deploying GenAI-powered solutions for finance operations and automated workflows – to enhance efficiency for enterprises in Saudi. Upsource's CEO, Eng. Naif AlMogbel, noted that by aligning with Cognizant, they aim to "reshape what excellence in BPO means" and create future-ready solutions that redefine value for clients.</p>

    <p>In terms of success stories, Upsource has been instrumental in running customer service centers for major Saudi organizations (telecom operators, banks, government services). Its scale (9000+ staff) suggests it likely powers some of the largest call centers in the country, delivering millions of customer interactions. For Solutions by STC, Upsource adds a crucial piece in the value chain: outsourced human capital. It means Solutions can not only provide technology solutions, but also the people and process operation to run those solutions. For example, for a smart city command center or a new digital platform, Solutions can supply the platform and via Upsource supply the 24/7 operational staff to manage it – a compelling end-to-end value proposition.</p>

    <h4 style="color: #7C3AED; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Logical Applications for Business Solutions (LABS) – SAP Solutions Specialist</h4>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">LABS (Logical Applications for Business Solutions Co.) is a leading SAP Gold Partner in the Middle East, specializing in enterprise software solutions and consulting. In August 2024, Giza Arabia (and by extension Solutions by STC) acquired a majority stake in LABS. LABS is an established player with over 10 years of experience in implementing and supporting SAP solutions for organizations of all sizes. Headquartered in Jeddah with operations in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, and the UAE, LABS has a team of 100+ highly skilled SAP consultants covering the full suite of SAP products. It is also a certified SAP Partner Center of Expertise (PCoE), which attests to its high standards in SAP service delivery.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">LABS' offerings include SAP Business Applications (ERP, CRM, SCM), Business Intelligence & Analytics (including SAP Analytics Cloud), Enterprise Mobility, and database and technology services around SAP's platform. By integrating LABS, Solutions by STC can now deliver comprehensive enterprise application solutions – essentially, it can not only provide the infrastructure and integration, but also the core business applications that run on top. LABS significantly enhances the group's capabilities in sectors like government and large enterprise where SAP is prevalent. For example, LABS and Solutions by STC can jointly approach a government entity to offer a full digital transformation: modernize their data center (Solutions), implement SAP S/4HANA for their ERP (LABS), and manage the whole environment post go-live (Solutions Managed Services).</p>

    <p>This acquisition opens up new cross-selling opportunities. Giza Arabia's CEO noted that LABS' expertise perfectly aligns with Giza's mission and will help explore new sectors, especially in government, by providing 360° solutions encompassing SAP + cloud. One immediate joint offering is deploying SAP Analytics Cloud for clients to gain real-time insights from both SAP and non-SAP systems, which LABS is adept at. In summary, LABS adds the enterprise software layer to Solutions by STC's stack. A success story for LABS itself is its award-winning SAP implementations – LABS has earned multiple awards from SAP for quality and has strong testimonials from clients for improving business outcomes. As part of STC's innovation showcase, LABS demonstrates capabilities in ERP digitization and advanced analytics, which are key for any digital enterprise scenario.</p>

    <h4 style="color: #7C3AED; font-size: 1.25rem; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Integrated Value Proposition and Synergy</h4>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Collectively, the sister companies above – Giza, Nile, AvidBeam, ARIA, Devoteam, Upsource, and LABS – significantly broaden what Solutions by STC can offer. The joint offerings enabled by this portfolio span nearly every facet of modern technology: from connectivity and cloud infrastructure (STC core) to IoT and smart city solutions (Giza, Huawei, AvidBeam), from enterprise applications (LABS) to cutting-edge AI (SenseTime partnership, AvidBeam) and from consulting strategy (Devoteam) to operational execution (Upsource BPO). This means Solutions by STC can approach a customer with an integrated, one-stop solution for transformation.</p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">For example, consider a "Smart City Command Center" offering that a customer (like a city municipality or real estate developer) might see in the Innovation Lab: Solutions by STC can provide the secure connectivity and cloud platform; Giza/ARIA can integrate smart sensors, CCTV and automation systems on the ground; AvidBeam can analyze video feeds for public safety; Huawei (partner) can supply smart city ICT hardware (more below); Devoteam can consult on smart city strategy and user experience; and Upsource can even run the command center operations on behalf of the city. All of these pieces come together under Solutions by STC's orchestration.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the acquisitions have already shown customer win synergy. The Giza acquisition has expanded Solutions by STC's customer base to new regions and industries – for instance, Giza's existing clients in Egypt/UAE become STC's potential clients for other services, and vice versa. We have also seen internal synergies like Solutions by STC leveraging Giza's VAS subsidiary to become a direct distributor for Dell, boosting profitability on hardware sales. The Devoteam alliance means STC can bid for large digital consulting projects it previously might have missed. The Upsource-Cognizant partnership brings GenAI tech that STC can offer to its banking and telecom clients who outsource customer service. In summary, the sister companies dramatically reinforce Solutions by STC's innovation narrative – each adding unique capabilities that, when combined, allow creation of novel solutions not possible by any single entity alone. These joint capabilities will be showcased in the Innovation Lab to "wow" customers with what the STC Group can achieve as an integrated force.</p>
